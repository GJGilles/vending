  - text: Hi Bunta! My Mom told me that you might know something about selling food
      to humans?
    speaker: 0
  - text: Yes, I think I can help you there. Are you familiar with the songs of the
      land?
    speaker: 1
  - text: Yep! I just used it recently to pick some tea leaves.
    speaker: 0
  - text: Humans can be influenced by our songs as well, but it is more complicated
      than persuading plants. I will teach you a song that you can play that should
      help you sell your tea, but for other flavours and foods you will need new
      songs. You should be able to find many new songs on your travels use them to
      sell many things. When you see an insturment like this one, simply play your
      song and watch the peoples opinions change.
