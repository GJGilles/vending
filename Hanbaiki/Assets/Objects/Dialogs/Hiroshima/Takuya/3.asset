  - text: Ha! Thats great, Takumi! You probably opened one of my old vending machine
      portals I used to sell to humans in my old travelling days

    speaker: 1
  - text: You are old enough to travel on your own, if you want, dear. But travelling
      isn't exactly free. We can give you a bit of money to help, but you are going
      to need to show us that you can support yourself like your sister before we
      feel safe letting you go.

  - text: Huh, ... well, thats fair... Just let me think.

  - text: Wait! Didn't Dad say that he used a vending machine to sell to humans?
      I could do the same! There are a lot more of them than Yokai!
    speaker: 0
  - text: Well, selling to humans is a bit more complicated as well, but if you can
      prove that you can do it then that would be a good source of income...
    speaker: 1
  - text: Alright, dear. If you can sell 10 cups of green tea to the humans then
      I will buy you a train ticket to Okayama to start your journey.
    speaker: 2
  - text: Thanks Mom! Thanks Dad! I'm off to sell some tea!
